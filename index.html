        <h2>Why I Joined the AltSchool Program</h2>
        <p>
            I joined ALTSchool because I didn’t want to follow the traditional university path, I knew it wasn’t for me. I was searching for a space that understood my decision, 
            where I would not be judged for choosing a different route into tech. Just when I got tired of looking and felt like giving up, I found AltSchool.
             It felt like the place I had been hoping for one that saw my potential and gave me room to grow on my own terms.
